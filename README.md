# StarRocks Community
Welcome to the StarRocks community! We're glad to have you here.
This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the StarRocks community, improving code, docs, and giving talks.

## Culture and Values
* ### Inclusiveness, respect, and collective strength
The community will listen carefully to the voice of every person, whether it is about code or community culture. Everyone is welcome to express their opinions and 
ideas (but this doesn't include verbal attacks or discrimination against individuals, regardless of nationality, religion, gender, etc.).
The community upholds the principle of "Many hands make light work", which is the key for the community to grow and prosper.

* ### Contribution brings growth, growth promotes success
The community welcomes and values any form of contribution (new requirements, solutions, technical evangelism, etc.), 
not just code. Every contribution makes a difference for the community. Continuous contribution also injects strong vitality to the community. This is a virtuous circle of common growth. We believe that community success also brings success to every contributor.

* ### Ardent love brings commitment and fulfillment
Love to make ordinary things great is a spirit. There are always a group of people in the community who tirelessly answer every question, 
actively participate in every public discussion, and work hard to overcome every technical problem. This is love. We look forward to you becoming one of them and passing on your love to others.
